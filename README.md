# MeRLin
MeRLin (Melanoma Resistance Lineage tracing) is a high-resolution lineage tracing system integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH), and computational analyses to longitudinally track the clonal and transcriptional fates of melanoma cells under targeted therapy.
